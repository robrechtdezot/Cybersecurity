ANONYMITY CHECKLIST FOR KALI LINUX
PRE-BOOT
    Use live boot or encrypted disk (preferably Full Disk Encryption with LUKS)
    Secure BIOS/UEFI (disable boot from USB/CD, set BIOS password)
    Consider air-gapped Kali VM for highest opsec
    Use non-persistent storage if full deniability is needed (Tails style)

SYSTEM-LEVEL CHANGES
    Spoof hostname
    Spoof MAC address (random each boot)
    Spoof timezone and locale
    Disable mDNS, UPnP, Bluetooth, and unnecessary services
    Wipe RAM on shutdown (if applicable)

NETWORK ANONYMITY
    Always use VPN + Tor (VPN first, Tor after)
    Kill switch on VPN
    DNS over HTTPS or DNSCrypt
    Block all outbound traffic by default (UFW or iptables)
    Test for leaks (IP, DNS, WebRTC, etc.)

TOOLS & PRACTICES
    Use proxychains for tools like nmap, curl, wget
    Use firejail to sandbox browsers and apps
    Use whoami-project to manage spoofing (after verifying its behavior)
    Use Tor Browser or hardened Firefox with privacy extensions
    Avoid real email, usernames, fingerprinting
    Separate personas (different virtual machines for different identities)

DATA PROTECTION
    Securely wipe unused disk space
    Use cryptsetup or Veracrypt for files and containers
    Remove EXIF metadata from files/images
    Clear memory caches, bash history, and logs

OPSEC BEHAVIOR
    Never reuse usernames or data from your real identity
    Don’t login to personal accounts or use personal habits
    Always assume someone is watching: plan for metadata leaks

EXTRA'S

        OPSEC Training:
            Use Tails or Whonix when maximum deniability is needed.
            Don’t just hide—blend in. Anonymity is often broken by standing out.
